# 2-Bootstrap-Portfolio

This website is used to show how to utilize the Bootstrap framework in order for your website to scale properly when viewed on different screen resolutions.

In order to use Bootstrap on your website, you need to include the following link in the head of your HTML:

 link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"

In order for Bootstrap to work, you must label your HTML objects with proper class names. This is how the Bootstrap CSS identifies that the object in the HTML is Bootstrap. The linked Bootstrap CSS identifies these classes and provides the proper scaling when the browser resolution changes.

Here are examples of the following:

class="container-fluid"
class="col-md-6 col-lg-6"

In order to find the more examples of the different bootstrap classes, you can go to the following site:
